# Rules
- Follow proper coding naming convention. 
- Keep everything inside a single git repository. But yes you can create many projects inside the repository.
- For coding tasks always use maven based project.
- Create PR for review.
- Dont commit target directory. Always commit src/ and pom.xml for java projects. Must write junit test case.
- For every section you should have a README.md file.
  - Let say the section is Maven. Then you can create a READMe.md file under maven/README.md. You can do this
  as shown below.
  - Add File > Create New File. ![image](https://github.com/one-note/active-tasks/assets/17001948/4e67b907-33e0-41e0-9c14-28fc21cf6865)
  - In the box write: maven/README.md : ![image](https://github.com/one-note/active-tasks/assets/17001948/97bc962d-cc66-49c9-a3bd-cf12546dae43). The / after maven
    creates a folder. See here: ![image](https://github.com/one-note/active-tasks/assets/17001948/291c96cd-0c91-44d0-902e-477b5526480d)
  - Then do commit changes. Refresh the page. Then you can clone or pull changes to local. Start doing the tasks given for Maven inside maven directory you created
    above.
