# active-tasks


# Rules
- Follow proper coding naming convention. 
- Keep everything inside a single git repository. But yes you can create many projects inside the repository.
- For coding tasks always use maven based project.
- Create PR for review.
- Dont commit target directory.
- For every section you should have a README.md file.
  - Let say the section is Maven. Then you can create a READMe.md file under maven/README.md. You can do this
  as shown below.
  - Add File > Create New File. ![image](https://github.com/one-note/active-tasks/assets/17001948/4e67b907-33e0-41e0-9c14-28fc21cf6865)
  - In the box write: maven/README.md : ![image](https://github.com/one-note/active-tasks/assets/17001948/97bc962d-cc66-49c9-a3bd-cf12546dae43). The / after maven
    creates a folder. See here: ![image](https://github.com/one-note/active-tasks/assets/17001948/291c96cd-0c91-44d0-902e-477b5526480d)
  - Then do commit changes. Refresh the page. Then you can clone or pull changes to local. Start doing the tasks given for Maven inside maven directory you created
    above.

## Maven

- Create Maven project called maven-hello-world
- Execute commands like clean, compile, test, package, install, verify. Know why they are used.
- Add junit 4 dependency or junit 5 dependency
- Write test case for Calculator Program. Your test code must be under src/test/java
- In the same project do this example: https://www.baeldung.com/java-apache-commons-text


## Design Patterns

Understand Composition and Aggregation. Has-A and Is-A relationship.

- Singleton
- Factory
- Template
- Strategy
- Builder
- Prototype

Know why the above design patterns used.

Write README.md notes. Write code in a maven based project file examples with proper naming convention. All this can be kept in a single project called
design-patterns. No need to create a new repository on git for this.

## Data Structure
- LinkedList (custom). Dont use java collection provided LinkedList. Do 10 different problems on LinkedList.
- Array. Do 5 different problems.
- Row wise traveral of array. Column wise traversal of array.
  
## Logging With Logback

- https://mkyong.com/logging/slf4j-logback-tutorial/
- Why logging used.
- What is slf4j or logback
- What are logging levels
- What are appenders
- What are rolling policies avaialable.

Using draw.io design diagrams as didcussed above but it should not be what we learned above. refer other videos.
