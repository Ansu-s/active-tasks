# What is happening here...? 
- We created a table in the html file by using the table tag. A table has two useful elements such as thead to represent the heading part and tbody element to crate the rows and columns of the table.
- We assigned different javascript functions to the buttons using the onclick event property.
- For rows creation the javascript function addRow() accesses the table body part by using the getElementsByTagName method.
- Then we created a new row element which is the HTML Table Row Element we added different cells to it. The function gets executed each time we press Add Row button.
- To delete multiple rows we check the status of the checkboxes in the table and iterate through the collection of the checkboxes and check which one is selected and pass that row number or deletRow() to delete it.
- After performing the delete operation we updated the Serial No so the table's serial numbers are is in correct state.
