# Calculator using only HTML, CSS and Javascript   
## How the calculator works...?  
- Here we have created a div and added different buttons to it, each button has a specific value which value which will set the div displayResult field to it's assigned value
- The AC button will set the div to an empty field which will make it appear clear after we pressed it
- The DEL button will convet the value of div displayResult to sring and remove its last element my using the slice method
- In order to process the output of the expression present in the displayResult div we will use the eval() to evaluate expression present in it on clicking of the equals (=) button
- The div is set to display the output of the evaluated expression
