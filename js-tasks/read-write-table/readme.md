# What is happening here...?

- We have an input element which will take the input from the user and add it into the city table below.
- If we enter a city name and press the Add City button then the data is collected form the label and passed as the cityName to addCity() function and a new row is inserted into the table.
- We can add multiple cities to the table.
- To delete multiple rows from the table we can pass the row numbers by verifying if the checkbox is checked or not, we can pass the index of the rows to the deleteRow() to delete them.
- We update the serial numbers to maintain their correctness.
