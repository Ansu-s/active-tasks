## Maven

- Create Maven project called maven-hello-world
- Execute commands like clean, compile, test, package, install, verify. Know why they are used.
- Add junit 4 dependency or junit 5 dependency
- Write test case for Calculator Program. Your test code must be under src/test/java

## Design Patterns

Understand Composition and Aggregation. Has-A and Is-A relationship.

- Singleton
- Factory
- Template
- Strategy
- Builder
- Prototype

Know why the above design patterns used.

Write README.md notes. Write code in a maven based project file examples with proper naming convention. All this can be kept in a single project called
design-patterns. No need to create a new repository on git for this.
