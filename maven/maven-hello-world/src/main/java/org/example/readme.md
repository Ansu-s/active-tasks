# Basic Maven Commands
</div>

## mvn clean

- Clean: It removes all the files and directories generated by Maven during the build process. This includes the target directory where compiled classes, libraries, and other build artifacts are stored. Cleaning the project ensures a fresh start for the next build.

- Temporary Files: Maven may generate temporary files and folders during the build process. The mvn clean command also removes these temporary files, helping to maintain a clean project structure.
 ```maven
mvn clean
```
The below images show the changes in the directory due to the clean command

## mvn compile

- Dependency Resolution: Maven first resolves project dependencies defined in the project's pom.xml file. It downloads any required external libraries (dependencies) from remote repositories and stores them in the local Maven repository for later use.

- Compilation: After resolving dependencies, Maven compiles the project's source code. It looks for Java source files (usually located in the src/main/java directory by default) and compiles them into bytecode. The compiled classes are typically stored in the target/classes directory.

- Resource Copying: Along with compiling Java source files, Maven also copies resources (such as configuration files, XML files, etc.) from the src/main/resources directory to the target/classes directory.

- Plugin Execution: Maven plugins associated with the compilation phase are executed. These plugins can perform various tasks related to code generation, bytecode manipulation, or other custom build steps.
```maven
mvn compile
```

## mvn test

When we run mvn test, it triggers the execution of unit tests for your Java project. Here's what this command does:

- Compiles Code: Maven will first compile your project's source code if it hasn't already been compiled.

- Execute Tests: After compilation, Maven will search for test classes in your project's source code that follow naming conventions (e.g., test classes with names ending in "Test" by default). It then runs these test classes.

- Test Results: During the test execution, Maven will display information about the tests being run, such as the number of tests executed, passed, and failed.

- Reporting: Maven generates test reports in various formats (e.g., XML and HTML) by default. These reports provide detailed information about test results, including any failures or errors.

- Build Lifecycle: The test phase is part of Maven's build lifecycle. Running mvn test also implies running earlier phases like compile and test-compile if necessary.

```maven
mvn test
```

## mvn package
When we run mvn package, Maven performs several tasks:

- Compile Source Code: Maven compiles the source code in your project. It looks for Java source files (usually in the src/main/java directory) and compiles them into bytecode class files.

- Run Tests (Optional): If your project includes unit tests (usually located in the src/test/java directory), Maven may also run these tests during the build process. The tests are typically written using a testing framework like JUnit.

- Package Artifacts: After compilation and testing (if enabled), Maven packages your project's artifacts into a distributable format. The specific format depends on your project's packaging type, which is defined in your project's pom.xml (POM) file. Common packaging types include JAR (Java Archive), WAR (Web Application Archive), and more.

- Copy Artifacts to the Target Directory: The resulting packaged artifact(s) are copied to the target directory within your project. For example, if you are building a JAR, you will find the JAR file in the target directory.
```maven
mvn packge
```

## mvn install

This command is used to build and install a project's artifacts (usually JAR files) into the local Maven repository.
Here's what the command do:

- install: This is a Maven lifecycle phase. When you run mvn install, Maven will execute all the phases of the default lifecycle up to and including the "install" phase. This typically includes phases like "validate," "compile," "test," "package," and finally "install."
When you run mvn install, Maven will perform tasks such as compiling your project's source code, running tests, packaging the project into its distributable format (usually a JAR or WAR file), and then copying the resulting artifact into your local Maven repository.

The local Maven repository is a local cache of dependencies and project artifacts on your development machine. Other projects can then use these artifacts as dependencies, making it easier to manage dependencies within your local development environment.
```maven
mvn install
```

## mvn verify

When we run mvn verify, Maven performs several tasks:

- Clean: It starts by cleaning the project, which means it removes any previously compiled files and resources from the target directory.

- Compile: Maven compiles the source code of your project, converting it from human-readable Java code into bytecode that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

- Test: It runs the tests that are associated with your project. These tests are typically located in the src/test directory and are written using testing frameworks like JUnit or TestNG.

- Package: Maven packages the compiled code and resources into a distributable format, such as a JAR (Java Archive) file for libraries or a WAR (Web Archive) file for web applications.

- Verify: This is where  verify phase comes into play. It checks the results of the integration tests, ensuring that they pass successfully. Integration tests are different from unit tests as they typically involve multiple components of your application working together.

If all the phases, including the verification of integration tests, are successful, the mvn verify command will report a successful build. If any of the phases fail, it will stop and report the failure.
```maven
mvn verify
```
