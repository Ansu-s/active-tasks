Their is also a program demonstrating the apache commons.

### Logging using slf4j 

To demonstrate how to perform logging operation in a java application, I hava added the dependency in Maven for slf4j and logback.

To ensure log-file contain certain levels of logs I have also added properties in the configuration file.
