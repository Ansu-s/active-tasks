# Java Servlets
 
</div>  

A Java Servlet is a server-side technology that extends the capabilities of web servers by providing a mechanism to dynamically generate content and respond to client requests. Servlets are part of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE, now Jakarta EE) and are commonly used to develop web applications.



1. **Server-Side Java Technology:**
    - Servlets are Java classes that run on the server-side, handling requests from web clients (browsers) and generating dynamic content.

2. **Request-Response Model:**
    - Servlets follow a request-response model, where a servlet receives HTTP requests, processes them, and sends back HTTP responses to clients.

3. **Extends HttpServlet Class:**
    - Servlets typically extend the `HttpServlet` class, which provides methods to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).

4. **Lifecycle Methods:**
    - Servlets have lifecycle methods such as `init()`, `service()`, and `destroy()`, allowing developers to manage resources and perform setup and cleanup tasks.

5. **Servlet Container:**
    - Servlets are managed and executed by a servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat). The container handles the lifecycle of servlets, manages concurrent requests, and provides essential services.

6. **Dynamic Content Generation:**
    - Servlets are used to generate dynamic content by embedding Java code within HTML or other markup languages. This allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive web applications.

7. **Handling Form Submissions:**
    - Servlets are commonly used to process HTML forms, extracting form data from requests and performing server-side processing.

8. **Session Management:**
    - Servlets can manage user sessions by using features like session tracking, allowing the server to maintain stateful interactions with clients.

9. **Integration with Java EE Technologies:**
    - Servlets are often used in conjunction with other Java EE technologies such as JSP (JavaServer Pages), JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), and EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans) for building robust enterprise-level applications.

10. **Portability:**
    - Servlets are platform-independent and can run on any servlet container that complies with the Java Servlet API specifications.

Java Servlets have been a fundamental technology for building dynamic web applications in Java for many years. While newer technologies like Spring Boot have gained popularity for building modern web applications, servlets remain a foundational part of Java web development.
